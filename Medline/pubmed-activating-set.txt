TI  - Detection of BRAF V600E activating mutation in papillary thyroid carcinoma using PCR 
      with allele-specific fluorescent probe melting curve analysis.
PG  - 1211-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: A single hotspot mutation at nucleotide 1799 of the BRAF gene has been 
      identified as the most common genetic event in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), 
      with a prevalence of 29-83%. AIMS: To use a PCR assay to molecularly characterise 
      the BRAF activating point mutation in a series of PTC and benign thyroid cases and 
      correlate the mutation results with histological findings. METHODS: Formalin-fixed 
      paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections were evaluated for the BRAF V600E mutation using 
      LightCycler PCR with allele-specific fluorescent probe melting curve analysis 
      (LCPCR). RESULTS: 42 (37 PTC; 5 benign) surgical tissue samples were analysed for 
      the BRAF V600E activating point mutation. Using LCPCR and direct DNA sequencing, the 
      BRAF mutation was identified in 23/37 (62.2%) PTC FFPE samples. DNA sequencing 
      results demonstrated confirmation of the mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of 
      BRAF-activating mutations in PTC suggests new approaches to management and treatment 
      of this disease that may prove worthwhile. Identification of the BRAF V600E 
      activating mutation in routine FFPE pathology samples by a rapid laboratory method 
      such as LCPCR could have significant value.

TI  - Activating Mutation of SHP2 Establishes a Tumorigenic Phonotype Through 
      Cell-Autonomous and Non-Cell-Autonomous Mechanisms.

AB  - Gain-of-function mutation of SHP2 is a central regulator in tumorigenesis and cancer 
      progression through cell-autonomous mechanisms. Activating mutation of SHP2 in 
      microenvironment was identified to promote cancerous transformation of hematopoietic 
      stem cell in non-autonomous mechanisms. It is interesting to see whether therapies 
      directed against SHP2 in tumor or microenvironmental cells augment antitumor 
      efficacy. In this review, we summarized different types of gain-of-function SHP2 
      mutations from a human disease. In general, gain-of-function mutations destroy the 
      auto-inhibition state from wild-type SHP2, leading to consistency activation of 
      SHP2. We illustrated how somatic or germline mutation of SHP2 plays an oncogenic 
      role in tumorigenesis, stemness maintenance, invasion, etc. Moreover, the 
      small-molecule SHP2 inhibitors are considered as a potential strategy for enhancing 
      the efficacy of antitumor immunotherapy and chemotherapy. We also discussed the 
      interconnection between phase separation and activating mutation of SHP2 in drug 
      resistance of antitumor therapy.

TI  - RET haplotype, not linked to the C620R activating mutation, associated with 
      Hirschsprung disease in a novel MEN2 family.
PG  - 57-61
LID - S1807-59322012001300011 [pii]
AB  - Hirschsprung disease is a congenital form of aganglionic megacolon that results from 
      cristopathy. Hirschsprung disease usually occurs as a sporadic disease, although it 
      may be associated with several inherited conditions, such as multiple endocrine 
      neoplasia type 2. The rearranged during transfection (RET) proto-oncogene is the 
      major susceptibility gene for Hirschsprung disease, and germline mutations in RET 
      have been reported in up to 50% of the inherited forms of Hirschsprung disease and 
      in 15-20% of sporadic cases of Hirschsprung disease. The prevalence of Hirschsprung 
      disease in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 cases was recently determined to be 
      7.5% and the cooccurrence of Hirschsprung disease and multiple endocrine neoplasia 
      type 2 has been reported in at least 22 families so far. It was initially thought 
      that Hirschsprung disease could be due to disturbances in apoptosis or due to a 
      tendency of the mutated RET receptor to be retained in the Golgi apparatus. 
      Presently, there is strong evidence favoring the hypothesis that specific 
      inactivating haplotypes play a key role in the fetal development of congenital 
      megacolon/Hirschsprung disease. In the present study, we report the genetic findings 
      in a novel family with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2: a specific RET haplotype 
      was documented in patients with Hirschsprung disease associated with medullary 
      thyroid carcinoma, but it was absent in patients with only medullary thyroid 
      carcinoma. Despite the limited number of cases, the present data favor the 
      hypothesis that specific haplotypes not linked to RET germline mutations are the 
      genetic causes of Hirschsprung disease.

TI  - Epidermal growth factor receptor-activating mutation(E746_T751>VP) in pancreatic 
      ductal adenocarcinoma responds to erlotinib, followed by epidermal growth factor 
      receptor resistance-mediating mutation (A647T): A case report and literature review.
PG  - 950-954
LID - 10.4103/jcrt.JCRT_729_18 [doi]
AB  - Despite recent advances in treatment with multidrug chemotherapy regimens, outcomes 
      of patients with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remain very poor. 
      Treatment with targeted therapies has shown marginal benefits due to intrinsic or 
      acquired resistance. Actionable mutations, while detected infrequently in patients 
      with PDAC, are becoming increasingly used in personalized medicine. Here, we 
      describe an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-activating mutation 
      (E746_T751>VP) to erlotinib, a first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), in 
      a patient with metastatic PDAC. After an initial partial response to erlotinib for 
      12 months, the patient's disease progressed with emergence of the EGFR A647T 
      mutation. Certainly, the patient also progressed after switching therapy to a 
      third-generation EGFR TKI (osimertinib). This case illustrates the posttreatment 
      evolution of EGFR A647T-mediated resistance to the first- and third-generation TKIs. 
      To our knowledge, this is the first case to report the aforementioned activating and 
      resistance-mediated mutations. In summary, genomic analysis performed in this 
      patient with PDAC on the tumor biopsy and peripheral blood provided tools to 
      understand mechanisms of response and resistance to targeted therapy with EFGR TKIs.

      afatinib in EGFR activating mutation-positive advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.
PG  - S9-S17
LID - 10.3747/co.25.3732 [doi]
AB  - Despite recent advances in the systemic therapy of non-small-cell lung cancer 
      (nsclc), the prognosis for stage iv disease remains poor. The discovery of 
      targetable mutations has led to new treatment options. The most common mutations, 
      the EGFR activating mutations, are present in about 50% of Asian patients and up to 
      15% of white patients. First-generation reversible epidermal growth factor receptor 
      (egfr) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tkis) have led to improved survival in patients 
      positive for EGFR activating mutations, but resistance eventually leads to disease 
      progression. The irreversible egfr tki afatinib was developed to counter such 
      resistance. The clinical efficacy of afatinib has been shown in first-line studies 
      comparing it with both cytotoxic chemotherapy and first-generation egfr tkis. 
      Afatinib has also shown continued benefit beyond progression while a patient is 
      taking an egfr inhibitor. Furthermore, its toxicity profile is both predictable and 
      manageable. The results of the principal clinical trials assessing afatinib are 
      reviewed here.

AB  - Previously an increased frequency of KIT aberrations in mucosal melanomas was 
      reported, whereas c-KIT in most types of cutaneous melanomas does not appear to be 
      of pathogenetic importance. Imatinib has become the standard of care in other 
      cancers with KIT mutations such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Recently 12 
      cases of metastatic melanoma and KIT-activating mutations have been published to be 
      successfully treated with c-KIT blockers such as imatinib, sunitinib, dasatinib or 
      sorafenib. We report here on one of our patients with KIT-activating mutation in 
      metastatic anal mucosal melanoma, who showed a response to imatinib therapy and 
      summarize the available literature regarding this new therapeutic option.
